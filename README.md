# CMD-X-qfork
#### **branch -- main.**
Probably the dumbest reason for a fork you could've ever seen, just a few edits to the Source file.

Because i can't figure out theming in CMD-X, i'll just add a few commands here and there.

Also, i will probably just implement iy's swim command here, because the one in here is just an anim change with float(as far as i can tell) lol.
# Features:
merged admin stuff from an  of the admin stuff because i can't just have secure forks lol.



## TBA
no theme yet, bc im not really good with lua. also i cant figure out if theming actually works in CMD-X. i *might* reimplement theming, but eh.. im too lazy honestly.
### original readme
# CMD-X
A ROBLOX admin script with over 600 commands. Under reformation, V2.0.0 coming soon or something I guess.
